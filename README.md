# GPS-Tracker-TCP-Server
This repository contains a PHP-based TCP server that listens for connections from GT06 GPS devices, processes the incoming GPS data, and logs the information in real-time. The server handles IMEI extraction, GPS data decoding, and provides a template for developing more sophisticated GPS tracking and processing solutions
